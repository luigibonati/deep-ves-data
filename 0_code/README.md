The file `NeuralNetworkVes_ORIGINAL.cpp` contains the original implementation, which has been developed with LibTorch 1.0 and PLUMED 2.5. 

The file `NeuralNetworkVes.cpp` contains an updated version compatible with PLUMED 2.8 and PyTorch 1.8. Note that this has not been extensively tested, and not all features are working (e.g. restart or Monte Carlo based update).
