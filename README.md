Supporting data for the DEEP-VES paper

This repository contains code, input files and results of the paper: Neural networks based variationally enhanced sampling, arXiv:1904.01305. 

In the zip file you can find:
0)	Implementation of the DEEP-VES method in PLUMED2 (requires LibTorch).
1)	Input (PLUMED) and results of the simulations of the Wolfe-Quapp potential 
2)	Inputs (PLUMED and GROMACS) and results of alanine dipeptide and tetrapeptide simulations
3)	Inputs (PLUMED and LAMMPS) and results of the silicon crystallization simulations

Please note that the code is provided without documentation, since we are currently working on it. We are going to release it soon in PLUMED2. Stay tuned for updates.
